unzip the files into a folder of your choosing and then run the .exe if you're on windows or
run the .86_64 file for linux. I don't have an apple computer to attempt to make this compatible
with Mac.

## Description
This was an idea from my friend [Yoshken](https://www.youtube.com/yoshken). This is a tracker that can be added to your overlay on OBS or any streaming program of your choosing that can capture windows.

## Visuals
Most of the visuals are inspired by Mario Kart's User interface.

## Installation
Literally just run the executable that can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/Robsington/MarioKartListTracker/releases/tag/Builds)

## Support
It's been a minute since I've worked on this particular project so I'm unsure how I developed the architecture and source code.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future or requests for an update to use Mario Kart World tracks let [Yoshken](https://www.youtube.com/yoshken) know.

## Shoutout
shoutout to my buddy Yoshken for having this idea for his stream and after a bit I finally created this repository to release it to the public. Willing to pick this one up again since if there's demand for it or if anyone wants me to make another version with tracks from a different game.

## License
Anyone is welcome to use this. Please consider spreading the word of this project to more people who may be interested in using this in their channels.

## Project status
project was uploaded as is. I have not touched this project in about 2-3 years. Willing to create different versions if anyone wants me to.
